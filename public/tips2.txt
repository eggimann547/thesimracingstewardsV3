Late lunge = 90% fault | overtaking | (BMW SIM GT Rule 5)
Divebomb fails 87% of the time | braking | (28k Dataset)
Under-braking punts = avoidable | braking | (Stewards AI)

Door open? Close it — you’re not required to yield | defense | (Stewards AI)
Weaving to break tow = blocking | defense | (BMW SIM GT Rule 2)
Defend once — then hold line | defense | (Stewards AI)

# === OVERTAKING & VORTEX ===
Overlap = right to apex | overtaking | (BMW SIM GT Rule 4)
