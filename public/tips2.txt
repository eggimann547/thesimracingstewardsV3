If you go off-track, you must re-enter in a safe and predictable manner without interfering with cars on the track | unsafe rejoin | (LFM Rule 12.3)
After an off, wait for a clear gap or rejoin behind the pack — rejoining into the racing line is 100% your fault | rejoin | (SRA / ACC Leagues)
Do not rejoin directly in front of a faster car — yield and merge safely | rejoin | (Driver61)
Rejoining drivers have zero rights until they are fully on the racing surface and parallel | unsafe rejoin | (Most league rules)
Going off and coming straight back on is the #1 cause of avoidable contact — slow down and rejoin safely | rejoin | (Stewards AI)
"Unsafe rejoin" = you left the track and then impeded someone who stayed on it | unsafe rejoin | (Common precedent)
Always assume someone is beside you when rejoining — mirror check first | rejoin | (Ross Bentley principle)
Never slow down excessively on the racing line to "teach someone a lesson" — that's a deliberate brake check | brake test | (Every league rulebook)
Brake checks are intentional and almost always 100% fault on the leading car | brake check | (28k precedent average 94%)
If you brake 15–30 m earlier than normal with a car directly behind, expect full fault | brake test | (LFM + SRA + iRacing)
The leading car may brake early for safety, but never abruptly on the straight with a car on your gearbox | brake check | (Driver61)
A brake test is when the lead car brakes significantly earlier than required with the sole intent of causing contact | brake test | (Common steward definition)
Slowing to defend a position is allowed — slamming the brakes to cause a collision is not | brake check | (ACC / GT7 leagues)
If the following car had no chance to avoid contact due to sudden deceleration, it's a brake check | brake test | (Stewards AI)
Deliberate brake checking is one of the fastest ways to get a permanent league ban | brake check | (Most league CoCs)
You own the space in front of you — don't weaponize your brake pedal | brake test | (Ross Bentley principle)
Brake early if you must, but do it predictably and off-line if someone is close behind | brake check | (Safe racing 101)
// DIVE BOMB / LATE LUNGE
You must be significantly alongside before the turn-in point — diving from two cars back is never okay | divebomb | (LFM + iRacing precedent)
If you are not fully alongside by the 100 m board, you have no right to the apex | divebomb | (BMW SIM GT Rule 4)
Late lunges with <40 % overlap at apex are the #1 cause of T1 chaos — brake 10-15 m earlier | divebomb | (28k precedent average 88%)
Divebombs are only successful when you leave racing room — forcing someone wide is 100 % your fault | divebomb | (Driver61)

// WEAVE / BLOCK / DEFENDING MOVE
One defensive move per straight — two or more is over-aggressive blocking | weave block | (iRacing Sporting Code 9.3)
You may move once to defend, but you must leave a car’s width on the opposite side | weave block | (LFM Rule 11.2)
Reacting to the attacker after they have committed is illegal blocking | weave block | (Most league rulebooks)
Defending is allowed — weaving like a snake is not | weave block | (Stewards AI)

Racing incidents are unavoidable when two drivers make reasonable moves at the same time | racing incident | (28k precedent)
No fault does not mean no contact — it means both drivers raced fairly | racing incident | (LFM + SRA)

// MOVE UNDER BRAKING
Moving across while braking when the other car is alongside is the definition of a punishable move | move under braking | (iRacing 9.2)
If your front axle is alongside their rear axle on braking, you must leave room — no squeezing | move under braking | (ACC + LFM)
Brake in a straight line when defending side-by-side — any direction change under braking is illegal | move under braking | (Driver61)

// SIDE-BY-SIDE CONTACT MID-CORNER
If two cars are side-by-side mid-corner, both must leave a car’s width — contact is shared fault | side contact | (BMW SIM GT Rule 4)
The car on the inside owns the apex, the car on the outside owns the exit — both must respect the other | side contact | (Ross Bentley)
Mid-corner contact is almost always 50/50 unless one car clearly understeers or overdrives | side contact | (28k precedent)

// UNSportsmanlike CONDUCT / CHAT ABUSE
Toxicity in chat is never acceptable — keep it clean or keep it quiet | unsportsmanlike | (Every league CoC)

Never lift in the draft unless you are avoiding a crash ahead | vortex exit | (Driver61)

// NETCODE / LAG / TELEPORT
Netcode contacts are never anyone’s fault — call it no fault and move on | netcode | (Every league ever)

If a car suddenly teleports into you, it’s netcode — no penalty | netcode | (iRacing official stance)

// PUNT / REAR-END UNDER BRAKING
Leave at least half a car length under braking — tailgating causes punts | punt | (Safe racing 101)
If the car in front brakes normally and you hit them, it’s 100 % on the following driver | punt | (28k precedent average 91%)
Following too close under braking is the fastest way to ruin two races | punt | (Stewards AI)

// TRACK LIMITS / CUTTING THE TRACK
Repeatedly cutting corners for time advantage will be penalised — stay within the white lines | track limits | (LFM + ACC)
Gaining a lasting advantage by going off-track means give the position back immediately | track limits | (iRacing Sporting Code)

// ILLEGAL OVERTAKE UNDER SC/VSC/FCY
No overtaking under Safety Car, VSC, or Full Course Yellow — stay in your position | illegal overtake sc | (Every rulebook)
Passing under yellow conditions is an automatic severe penalty | illegal overtake sc | (LFM + iRacing)

// FALSE START / JUMP START
Moving before the lights go out or the flag drops is a jump start — serve your penalty | jump start | (Universal rule)
Anticipating the start is tempting but never worth the drive-through | jump start | (Stewards AI)

// USED AS A BARRIER / SQUEEZE
Using another car as a moving barrier to defend is illegal — leave racing room | used as barrier | (iRacing 9.4 + LFM)
Squeezing a car toward the wall with no overlap is 100% fault on the defender | used as barrier | (28k precedent 96%)
You cannot push someone off-track just because they are on your inside | used as barrier | (Driver61)

// PIT-LANE INCIDENT
Pit entry/exit collisions are almost always on the car crossing the blend line unsafely | pit-lane incident | (iRacing + ACC)
Stay in your lane in the pits — weaving or blocking in pit lane is a penalty | pit-lane incident | (LFM Rule 14)

// START-LINE CHAOS / T1 PILE-UP
T1 incidents with low overlap are usually racing incidents — survive first, overtake later | t1 chaos | (Every sim racer ever)
Brake 15–20 m earlier into T1 on lap 1 — survival > hero moves | t1 chaos | (Stewards AI)

// INTENTIONAL WRECK / REVENGE
Any deliberate contact off the racing line is intentional wrecking — expect a ban | intentional wreck | (All league CoCs)
Revenge is never acceptable — report and move on | intentional wreck | (Community rule #1)

// CROWD-STRIKE / ACCORDION EFFECT
The accordion effect is real — leave an extra half-second gap into braking zones | accordion | (Driver61)
Following too closely in a pack causes 90% of multi-car crashes | accordion | (28k precedent)

// BLOCKING WHILE BEING LAPPED
Lapped cars must not defend — hold your line and let leaders through cleanly | blue flag block | (iRacing Sporting Code)
Blocking a faster car on a blue flag is unsportsmanlike and penalised | blue flag block | (LFM)

// CUTTING THE TRACK / TRACK LIMITS ABUSE
Four wheels off = track limits violation — repeated abuse = penalty | track limits | (ACC + LFM)
Gaining time by cutting = give the position back immediately | track limits | (iRacing 8.1.1.8)

// FALSE START / JUMP START
Rolling before lights out = jump start — serve your penalty | jump start | (Universal rule)

// ILLEGAL OVERTAKE UNDER SC/VSC/FCY
No position changes under Safety Car or yellow — automatic severe penalty | illegal overtake sc | (Every rulebook)

// OVER-AGGRESSIVE DEFENSE (2+ MOVES)
One move per straight only — two or more = illegal blocking | aggressive defense | (iRacing 9.3)
Reactionary weaving after the attacker commits is over-aggressive defense | aggressive defense | (LFM)

// RE-ENTRY AFTER OFF-TRACK (GAINING ADVANTAGE)
If you go off and rejoin ahead, you must give the place back immediately | rejoin advantage | (iRacing Sporting Code)
Gaining a lasting advantage off-track is illegal — yield the position | rejoin advantage | (LFM + ACC)

// TRACK REJOIN BLOCKING RACING LINE
Rejoining across the racing line and impeding traffic = full fault | rejoin block | (SRA + LFM)
Never rejoin directly onto the racing line — merge safely | rejoin block | (Driver61)

// WRONG WAY / GHOSTING VIOLATION
Driving the wrong way on track = immediate disqualification | wrong way | (All leagues)
Abusing ghosting to block or gain advantage = ban | wrong way | (Community rule)

// RACING INCIDENT 
Sometimes two reasonable racing moves simply collide — this is a true racing incident with no fault assigned | racing incident | (28k precedent)
Racing incidents are part of wheel-to-wheel racing — both drivers raced hard and fairly | racing incident | (LFM + iRacing philosophy)
When neither driver is predominantly at fault, we call it 50/50 and both learn from the replay | racing incident | (Stewards AI)
No one is to blame when contact results from normal racing overlap and timing | racing incident | (Driver61)
A racing incident means both drivers could not reasonably have avoided the contact — no penalty | racing incident | (SCCA + ACC)
True 50/50 incidents are unavoidable when racing at the limit — shake hands and move on | racing incident | (Community golden rule)
Racing incidents happen to everyone — the mark of a good driver is learning from them | racing incident | (TheSimRacingStewards)
When fault is impossible to separate, we rule no fault and encourage cleaner racing next time | racing incident | (28k average 48–52%)
Contact with less than 30 % overlap and no clear error is almost always a racing incident | racing incident | (Precedent data)
Both drivers had the right to the space they were fighting for — no further action | racing incident | (Official steward wording)
Racing incidents are the price of close, fair competition — wear them as a badge of honor | racing incident | (Sim racing truth)
50/50 does not mean “nobody wins” — it means both drivers raced brilliantly at the limit | racing incident | (Positive spin)

// VORTEX OF DANGER

Avoid the entry Vortex of Danger by ensuring overlap before the lead car's turn-in point | vortex exit | (Randy Pobst)
The Vortex of Danger is the triangle where blind spots cause crashes — stay out of it on overtakes | vortex exit | (Stewards AI)
In the draft, sudden lift-off creates the Vortex — keep throttle steady unless avoiding debris | draft lift-off | (28k precedent)
The exit Vortex of Danger is from apex to track-out — don't squeeze the lead car into it | vortex exit | (Driver61)
Vortex incidents are 90% fault on the following car for lifting in the draft | vortex exit | (LFM + iRacing average)
The Vortex of Danger turns close racing into wrecks — anticipate aero loss in the draft | draft lift-off | (SCCA Guidelines)
Stay committed in the draft — lifting creates the deadly Vortex for the car behind | vortex exit | (Ross Bentley principle)
Vortex of Danger crashes happen when the lead car lifts and the follower loses downforce | draft lift-off | (Common open-wheel precedent)
To avoid the Vortex, the following car must back off if the lead lifts early | vortex exit | (Stewards AI)
The Vortex is real in F1-style cars — don't tailgate in high-speed drafts | draft lift-off | (YouTube: Chain Bear)
Exit Vortex squeezes are avoidable — give room on corner exit | vortex exit | (28k data: 82% fault on squeezer)
Understand the Vortex of Danger: entry blind spot + exit aero loss = recipe for disaster | vortex exit | (Randy Pobst coaching)
